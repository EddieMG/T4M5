TRAINW5 is the same file we used on w4.

The other 4 .py files are the conversion done by Stanislaw.

We should run/check those 4 files and start week 5 deliveries.


TASKS:

(A) Evaluate on MOTS Qualitative and Quantitative both segm and object detection

(B) Evalutate on KITTI_VAL the following:
(do the same as week 4 but with MOTSChallenge on some models.)

(C) Hyperparameter search on COCO + Cityscapes + MOTSChallenge + KITTI-MOTS

 (1) Job: 6531 ->   cfg.MODEL.RPN.IOU_THRESHOLDS = [0.4, 0.6]
 (2) Job: 6532 ->   cfg.MODEL.RPN.IOU_THRESHOLDS = [0.2, 0.8] #defatults 0.3 and 0.7
 (3) Job: 6564 ->   cfg.MODEL.RPN.IOU_THRESHOLDS = [0.1, 0.9] #defatults 0.3 and 0.7

 (4) Job: 6570 -> Different LR scheduler "WarmupCosineLR" default: WarmupMultiStepLR" to get the values for the default get the job 6415

 (5) Job: 6567 -> cfg.MODEL.ANCHOR_GENERATOR.SIZES = [[32, 64]]
 (6) Job: 6598 -> cfg.MODEL.ANCHOR_GENERATOR.SIZES = [[256, 512]]

Take the best model of the ones above and tune hyperparameters. If we have extra time take the runnerups as well.

- Input resolution
� Data augmentation with cropping
� Number of top scoring precomputed proposals to keep for training
� Anchor sizes and anchor aspect ratios
� IOU overlap ratios [BG_IOU_THRESHOLD, FG_IOU_THRESHOLD]
� Number of top scoring RPN proposals to keep
� LR scheduler options
