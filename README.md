# Week 1 - Introduction to Pytorch

The main task in to implement the final model from M3 (Image Classification) in Pytorch.

The slides reporting the results obtained can be seen in [these Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n3wsHfT0nL-1LW-X02lgyh8OLpLObmZt5nEjD4H5RaE/edit#slide=id.p).

# Week 2 - Introduction to Object Detection
Main tasks:
(a) Getting familiar with Detectron2 framework

# Week 4 - Introduction to Object Segmentation

Main tasks:

(a) Apply pre-trained Mask-RCNN models to KITTI-MOTS validation set. Trying different configurations:
  - [x] Number of layers
  - [x] Backbone configuration
  - [x] Use of Feature Pyramid Network
  - [x] Use of training data (COCO vs COCO+Cityscapes)

(b) Train Mask-RCNN model on KITTI-MOTS training set and evaluate on KITTI-MOTS validation set
  - [x] COCO + KITTI-MOTS
  - [x] COCO + Cityscapes + KITTI-MOTS
