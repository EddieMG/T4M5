# Week 1 - Introduction to Pytorch
The main task in to implement the final model from M3 (Image Classification) in Pytorch.
The slides reporting the results obtained can be seen in [these Google Slides](https://).

# Week 2 - Introduction to Object Detection
Main tasks:
A. Getting familiar with Detectron2 framework
B. Use object detection models in inference: Faster RCNN
C. Use object detection models in inference: RetinaNet
D. Train a Faster R-CNN on KITTI dataset
The slides reporting the results obteined can be seen in [these Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14V1yCVCiOaDklb_7u7BKgAKRDSIhGrjze1V1CBX6Qm0/edit#slide=id.g7102907464_5_34).

# Week 3 - Multiple Object Tracking and Segmentation
Main tasks:
A. Get familiar with MOTSChallenge and KITTI-MOTS challenges
B. Use object pre-trained object detection models in inference on KITTI-MOTS
C. Evaluate pre-trained object detection models on KITTI-MOTS 
D. Train detection models on KITTI-MOTS and MOTSChallenge training sets
E. Evaluate best trained model on KITTI-MOTS test set
The slides reporting the results obteined can be seen in [these Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rppl8bJZF5lnt4Qxvoe_KrF_eDC2S-eNhT6g58L_NlE/edit#slide=id.g7168e8d968_29_0).

# Week 4 - Introduction to Object Segmentation
Main tasks:
A. Apply pre-trained Mask-RCNN models to KITTI-MOTS validation set. Trying different configurations:
1. Number of layers
2. Backbone configuration
3. Use of Feature Pyramid Network
4. Use of training data (COCO vs COCO+Cityscapes)
B. Train Mask-RCNN model on KITTI-MOTS training set and evaluate on KITTI-MOTS validation set
The slides reporting the results obteined can be seen in [these Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wxv_nS51v2C9CKlNpzeHORPC9lifEhkCmpZSD9jJOXA/edit#slide=id.g718556d907_1_0).

# Week 5 - Transfer Learning for Object Detection and Segmentation
Main tasks:
A. Apply pre-trained and finetuned Mask-RCNN models to MOTSChallenge train set
B. Apply pre-trained and finetuned Mask-RCNN models to KITTI-MOTS val set
C. Explore and analyze the impact of different hyperparameters
D. Extend Experiments section on your paper
